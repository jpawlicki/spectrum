Action co-op game:

	Sci-fi setting, where the players are people in suits of modular tanks.
The players are sent on a mission from the Federal Government to retrieve data 
cores containing research on items of significant importance to the ongoing war 
effort. The players have to work together to defeat enemies, as well as solve 
puzzles to make it to their goal.

	Not all the players have the same objectives, however - at the beginning of 
each mission players secretly choose a role that determines their win 
condition. Each mission may have specific objectives for each of the roles.
	+ Empire's Starguard - (Loyalist) - Usually win if a the datacore reaches an Empire dropship.
	+ Federal Planets Alliance - (Loyalist) - Likewise, but sometimes want to sabotage the Starguard?
	+ Tetraknife - (Mercenary) - Almost always, win condition is highest-loot extraction.
	+ 
	+ 

		+ House Kain (Loyalist): You win if the data core is carried to the dropship by a non-rebel.
		+ House Rorik (Rebel): You win if the data core is carried to the dropship by another rebel. You are told at the beginning of the game who the other rebels are.
		+ House Liau (Mercenary): You win if you get to the dropship with more sparks than anyone else.
		+ House Cooper (Pacifist): You win if the data core is destroyed.

	There is a variety of equipment that can be picked up. Each piece of 
equipment fills an equipment slot, of which players have 5. Equipment comes in 
three varieties: Weapon, Passive, and Active. Active equipment is bound to a 
hotkey when players pick it up, while passive equipment is doing something all 
the time. Players can have multiple weapons, but only one is usable at any time 
and switching takes a little time.
	Equipment List:
			[Weapons]
		+ Automatic Rifle: the automatic rifle is the most well-rounded gun, and does good damage at a decent firing rate, range, and accuracy.
		+ Vulcan Gun: the vulcan gun has a very fast firing rate but very low accuracy (high bullet spread). Other than this, it does well at range, and is good for crowd control.
		+ Rail Gun: the rail gun has a slow firing rate but shoots with extreme accuracy and high damage at any range. Its bullets also provide high-knockback. It is good against single enemies.
		+ Cluster Cannon: the cluster cannon fires a giant burst of ammunition that has high spread and does high damage but decellerates quickly and so is not good at range.
		+ Lance Cannon: the lance cannon fires a large projectile that does little damage but has enormous knock-back.
		+ Rocket: fires a rocket that explodes on impact, throwing all nearby entities away from the explosion and dealing splash damage. Deals very large damage, but ammunition is extremely limited (5).

			[Passive]
		+ Nanofactory: if you run out of ammunition, you can continue to shoot. Each shot drains sparks, however.
		+ Spare Shields: increases your shield points by +30.
		+ Grip Tracks: your skid threshold is doubled.
		+ Inertial Defense: forces exerted upon you by others and bullets move you 50% as much as they would otherwise.
		+ High Explosive Ammunition: each shot you have deals splash damage and has triple knockback. Lasts until your ammunition runs out.
		+ Low Profile Ammunition: each shot you shoot experiences only 1/3 normal drag. Lasts until your ammunition runs out.
		+ Sparkbattery: if you shut down and are damaged, you lose sparks at one third the normal rate.
		+ Burrowing Ammunition: the bonus from flank hits is doubled while you have this ammunition. Lasts until your ammunition runs out.
		+ Spare Ammunition Box: when you run out of ammo, your ammo is refilled and you lose this item.
		+ Stall Ammunition: hits with this ammunition score and count toward sync hits for half again as long as normal ammunition. Lasts until your ammunition runs out.
		+ Cascade Ammunition: hits with this ammunition deal bonus damage equal to half the damage dealt to the target in the last .5 seconds. Lasts until your ammunition runs out.
		+ Rammer: when you collide with another entity, you deal damage proportional to your speed. You take 1/4 normal damage from impacts.
		+ Hoverjets: you can cross pits without falling in.
		+ Heat Shielding: you can cross inferno zones without damage.
		+ Turbotreading: you move 25% faster.
		+ Absorbive Armor: you take no damage from impacts.
		+ Depleted Uranium Ammunition: the base damage of all shots you shoot deal 50% more damage.

			[Active]
		+ Sparkwell: Spend 25 sparks to attract all nearby sparks gravitationally for 15 seconds.
		+ Shield Supercharger: Spend 100 sparks to become invincible for 15 seconds.
		+ Proximity Mines: Spend 30 sparks to lay a mine that explodes when anyone comes near it. The mine arms after 5 seconds.
		+ Rocketpack: Spend 10 sparks, hurls you forward into a skid. May enable you to cross pits.
		+ Wormhole Generator: Spend 150 sparks, teleport to selected location.

	Ideas:
		+ The first four weapons are available at the start of each mission.
		+ Square buttons that require being held down to open a door - usually another player must go through and push a circle button to permanently open the door.
		+ Circle buttons have permanent effects when pushed.
		+ "Flank Hits" - show an 'F+5' on a hit, deal +5 damage per bullet. A flank hit is scored when the target has been hit by a bullet between 140 and 220 degrees within the last second.
		+ "Sync Hits" - when a target is hit by a different attackers within .2 seconds of each other, they score a sync hit, and each bullet's damage is multiplied by the number equal to the number of attackers participating in the sync hit.
		+ "Critical Hits" - most enemies have a weak zone. If the weak zone is hit, the shot deals bonus damage equal to 1/10th of the target's remaining hit points. Targets killed by a critical hit drop double sparks.
		+ When destroyed, most enemies drop just sparks, which can be picked up by players.
		+ When a player's shields run out, they shut down for a few seconds. Every point of damage they take drains a spark until they power back up with full shields. They also drop any Key Items and a random piece of equipment when this occurs.
		+ At special shield recharge stations, players can convert sparks into shield points.

	Obstacles:
		+ Ice! No friction!
		+ Circle Buttons: need to be held down to have an effect.
		+ Square Buttons: running over them toggles them.
		+ Hexagon Buttons: attached to a timer, running over them again resets the timer. Maybe they show the remaining time on the button? Time starts when you get off the button.
		+ AND gate, OR gate, etc? Wires connecting components?
		+ Chemical Pits: zones that players cannot cross without hoverjets or somehow being thrown or taking damage.
		+ Force Bridges: usually activated/deactivated by standing on square buttons. Enable others to cross pits without taking damage.
		+ Force Walls: usually activated/deactivated by standing on square buttons. Block bullets, people, and inferno jets.
		+ Bullethole: constantly shoots a stream of bullets directly away from itself.
		+ Inferno Jet: constantly shoots a stream of fire away from itself.
		+ Megafan: exerts a force on all passers-through.
		+ Riddles? Logic Puzzles?
		+ Whirling blades? Crushing pistons?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Idea 2: Each faction involved in the situation has a number of units and a 
number of players. The number of players is less than the number of tanks.

Players control one tank at a time, and rotate through them by pressing some 
key or another. Tanks not currently being controlled will conduct interception 
fire but will not move.

Most missions have unusual conditions: very few are simple stand-and-fight 
missions. The following things are building blocks to make scenarios out of:

	Repair Bay - tanks on this repairing platform regain hull points.
	Sensor Array - provides LOS in an area.

Scenario pieces:
		Primary Objectives:
	Destroy a particular vehicle/tank.
	Evacuate tanks off map.
	Escort moving object.
	Time limit - either last as long as possible or last to a given time.
	Destroy all opponent vehicles.
	Defend building / Destroy building.
	
			Secondary Objectives:
	Capture sensor array.
	
		Complications:
	Pre-existing damage.
	No reinforcements available.
	No repair bays.
	Choke points.
	Reinforcements have fixed (vulnerable) points.
	Some units are far away.
	Special units: remarkably weak, or remarkably strong.
	Force imbalances: more units vs less units.
	Ability to see entire map/be limited to fog of war.
